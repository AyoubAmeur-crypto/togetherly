      question: 'Do I need Microsoft Excel or paid software to use this?',
      answer:
        'No paid software is needed at all. The Couples Money Planner is built natively for Google Sheets. You only need a standard free Google account to access, edit, and collaborate in real time from any laptop, tablet, or smartphone.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do my partner and I use it together?',
      answer:
        'Because it runs in Google Sheets, you simply click "Share" and enter your partner\'s Google email address. Both of you can view, edit, enter expenses, and review your finances simultaneously or asynchronously from anywhere in the world.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can we change the currency and category names?',
      answer:
        'Yes, 100%. The Setup tab allows you to choose your primary currency ($ USD, € EUR, £ GBP, $ CAD, $ AUD, or custom). All categories, income sources, and goal names can be personalized in seconds to match your exact lifestyle.',

    {
      question: 'How does the Fair Split calculation work?',
      answer:
        'You can select either a standard 50/50 split or an Income-Proportional split (e.g., 60/40 if one partner earns more). As you log expenses, the system continuously compares who paid for what versus what each person was responsible for, presenting a single clean settlement amount at the end of the month.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my personal financial data safe and private?',

      question: 'Are there any recurring monthly subscription fees?',
